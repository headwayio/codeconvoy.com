              h3 Not a bootcamp
              p Bootcamps create a stressful and overwhelming experience for students because they rush students through learning with unrealistic expectations for learning speed and limited opportunities for review and practice. This isn't a bootcampâ€”you'll learn at your own speed while using effective learning techniques that lead to mastery.

              h3 One-room schoolhouse
              p Our class sizes are very small with a mix of students from different ages and ability levels. This creates a more interesting learning environment where students learn from each other, follow their own pace, and work with instructors individually.
